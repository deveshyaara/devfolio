## Style Guidelines:

- Color scheme: Dark theme.
- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to add a vibrant and modern touch. It creates contrast and enhances visual appeal.
- Background color: Dark grey (#28282B) creates a sophisticated backdrop that highlights the content and makes the electric blue primary color pop. The desaturation keeps the background subdued, ensuring it doesn't distract from the main elements.
- Accent color: Light cyan (#A7F0FF) draws attention and ensures important interactive elements donâ€™t go unnoticed.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short descriptions to bring a modern, tech-forward aesthetic, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to provide readability.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for skills and social media links.
- Single-page layout with smooth scrolling to each section.
- Subtle animations on hover for project cards and links.
